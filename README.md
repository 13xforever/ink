# inklecate2

##Â Installing the compiler

Run the `build_and_install_inklecate2.command` script. This will do two things:

 - Build the latest version of the compiler and install it in `/usr/local/bin/` with the name `inklecate2` so that you can access it from the command line.
 - Install syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 2 and 3.

 
## Building the runtime DLL (for Unity)

Run the `build-runtime-dll.command` script. This will build a DLL file and place it in `RuntimeDLL/inklewriter-engine.dll`.
